What’s not implemented yet (relative to “full” C4.5) 🚧

If we compare to Quinlan’s full C4.5 spec, missing pieces are:

Pessimistic post-pruning

C4.5 normally:

grows full tree,

then prunes subtrees whose estimated error is not better than a leaf (with a binomial estimate).

We don’t do post-pruning yet:

no error estimates,

no subtree replacement step.

We also don’t have pre-pruning knobs (like maxDepth, minSamples) in the current code.

Fractional handling of missing values

Real C4.5 treats missing attribute values in a more nuanced way, distributing instances fractionally among branches.

We chose a simpler approach:

* in examples means “ignore this attribute for this row” when scoring splits and building branches.

That’s good enough for your “expert shell” intent, but not a faithful reproduction of that part of the algorithm.

Repeated use of attributes in different regions (esp. numeric)

Conceptually supported:

after splitting on a numeric attribute in one region, it can be reused somewhere deeper for another threshold.

Our code allows that, but we haven’t stress-tested with more complex numeric domains yet.

No advanced stopping criteria / confidence thresholds

We stop when:

pure node,

no attributes left,

no attribute with positive gain ratio.

C4.5 sometimes uses more nuanced criteria with error estimates.
